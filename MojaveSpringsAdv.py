Welcome to the sunbaked expanse of the Mojave Desert, a rugged and unforgiving
terrain that hides secrets of years gone by. In this Python beginner's text
adventure you'll embark on an old-time journey, navigating the treacherous
Mojave Desert, gathering essential supplies to find water and conquer the
caverns, and ultimately making your way to the ghost town of Mojave Springs.

As you follow the dusty paths of previous explorers, you'll soon realize that
the true prize awaits you deep the heart of the forgotten town. Can you find
the key to entering the town's fortified bank and seize the legendary treasure
for your own?

With odds stacked against you, do you step into the shoes of a true desert
explorer and embark on this quest of fame and fortune?

# The End
# ===========================================================================
# Mojave Springs Adventure is not intended to be a full-blown adventure game. 
# I wrote it in about 40 hours (design, code) to get an understanding of Python.
# Following review by the first players I used ChatGPT to augment text
# to make the room and object descriptions more verbose and added "Hints".
# Changes took another 10 hours or so.

# Certainly, the game script could be enhanced and the code improved.
# That's where you come in.
# Learn from it, tear it apart, fix my coding faux pas, do with it whatever.

# Here are some ideas while still keeping this a terminal app:

# 1) Move room and object descriptions to a file or database
# 2) Enhance the action word parser - add language processing ability
# 3) Add puzzles the player can solve vs simply wandering around
# 4) Add NPCs (Non Player Characters) the player can interact with
