## Acknowledgements
This was my first Python program. I started by searching for "simple python text adventure" and researched Python coding styles. Mixed in some of my own spice and heated until you could taste some old fashioned text adventure goodness. Enjoy!

Based on initial playability review, I used ChatGPT to augment text to make the room and object descriptions verbose and added hints.

## Notes and Stuff You Can Do

Mojave Springs Adventure was not intended to be a full-blown adventure game. I wrote it in about 40 hours (design, code) to get an understanding of Python.
Certainly, the game play can be enhanced and the code improved. That's where you come in. Learn from it, tear it apart, fix my coding faux pas, do with it whatever.
If you mod it, I'd like to see where you take the game.

Here are some ideas while still keeping this a terminal app:
- Move room and object descriptions to a file or database
- Enhance the action word parser - add language processing ability
- Add puzzles the player can solve vs simply wandering around
- Add NPCs (Non Player Characters) the player can interact with
- Add a combat system so you can fight the snake or NPCs
- Add a scoring system
- Translate to other languages, Spanish and German :)

Have fun
